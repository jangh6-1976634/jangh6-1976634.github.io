                    <p>
                        Seven a.m., the usual morning lineup<br>
                        Start on the chores and sweep 'till the floor's all clean<br>
                        Polish and wax, do laundry, and mop and shine up<br>
                        Sweep again, and by then it's like 7:15<br>
                        And so I'll read a book<br>
                        Or maybe two or three<br>
                        I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery<br>
                        I'll play guitar and knit<br>
                        And cook and basically<br>
                        Just wonder when will my life begin?<br>
                        Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts and baking<br>
                        Paper mache, a bit of ballet and chess<br>
                        Pottery and ventriloquy, candle making<br>
                        Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch, take a climb<br>
                        Sew a dress!<br>
                        And I'll reread the books<br>
                        If I have time to spare<br>
                        I'll paint the walls some more<br>
                        I'm sure there's room somewhere<br>
                        And then I'll brush and brush<br>
                        And brush and brush my hair<br>
                        Stuck in the same place I've always been<br>
                        And I'll keep wanderin' and wanderin'<br>
                        And wanderin' and wonderin'<br>
                        When will my life begin?<br>
                        And tomorrow night<br>
                        The lights will appear<br>
                        Just like they do on my birthday each year<br>
                        What is it like<br>
                        Out there where they glow?<br>
                        Now that I'm older<br>
                        Mother might just<br>
                        Let me go</p>
